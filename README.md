### _Question_: Add at least 3 Project features

▶️ **Answer:** Here are three project features

#### 1. Donation Tracking and Visualization:

- The code includes features related to tracking and visualizing donations. It stores donation data in the local storage and retrieves it to display a list of donations on the "Donations" page.
- The "Statistics" page provides a visual representation of donation statistics using a pie chart. It calculates and compares the total donations made to the user's donations.

#### 2. Dynamic Routing and Navigation:

- The code demonstrates the use of React Router for handling client-side routing and navigation. It defines different routes for pages like the home page, donations page, donation details page, and statistics page.
- The navigation is achieved through links, allowing users to seamlessly move between different sections of the application.

#### 3. Responsive User Interface:

- The user interface is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. For example, the layout and content presentation change based on the screen width.
- The responsive design is evident in components like "StatisticsChart," which adjusts the size and layout of the pie chart based on the screen width, ensuring a better user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

These features collectively contribute to creating a web application for tracking and visualizing donations, allowing users to explore donation categories, view individual donations, and see donation statistics in an interactive and responsive manner.
